	<h2 id="3"><u>Trainings</u></h2>
	<img src="img4.jpeg" alt="image of kalari" width="400" height="300">
	<p>
		Kalaripayattu uses both armed and unarmed combat training.<br><br>
		Weaponry traditionally found in India such as the sword, shield, staff, deer-horn dagger, fist dagger and the deadly flexible sword were most commonly used.<br><br>
		For unarmed combat, quick movements comprising of several versions of strikes, locks, kicks and grappling were used to de-stabilise and take out opponents.<br><br>
		There are 8 Vadivas commonly practiced in modern day Kalaripayattu which are taken from the movements and poses from the animal kingdom. These Vadivas leverage off to work the body of the student to attack on an oncoming assault.<br><br>

	<h2 id="4"><u>Relation to yoga</u></h2>
	<img src="img5.jpeg" alt="image of kalari" width="400" height="350">
	<p>
		There is an inseperable relationship between Kalaripayattu and Yoga.<br><br> 
		Kalaripayattu's exercises have been known to enhance neuromuscular coordination and improve physio-psychological agility.<br><br>
		With breathing techniques, stretching callisthenics, combinations of the Vadivas, leg exercises, jumps and leaps and different forms of exercises for improving the flexibility of the body, Kalaripayattu is truly a powerful tool capable of transforming the body, emotions and consciousness of the student.<br><br>
		With this comes an inherent sense of alertness, agility, concentration, confidence, courage and discipline, not just of the body but of the mind as well.<br><br>
